For the Web APIs assignment I created this Pintrest/album/moodboard-thingy with a Single Page Application approach. It uses localStorage and history/location Web API to do it's magic. Users can browse the page and it's categories without relocating. There's also a like function, allowing users to put images to favorites and find them there upon return. The HTML/CSS is based on MD Bootstrap and all custom JS is vanilla. 

You'll find my code in the repo's root: index.html, main.js, style.css.
